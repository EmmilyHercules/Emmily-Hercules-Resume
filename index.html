        <div class="subheading mb-5"> History ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I'm a first year at University of California Riverside. I major in History and hope to work in museums one day. That way I actually get hands on experience with artifacts I spent years studying. It also allows me to educate a larger crowd of people with different backgrounds. There's a misconception that history needs to be memorized when really it should just be understood to point where you can form your own opinions. People need to understand how important it is to actually learn history since it's something that is still relevant today. People refuse to learn history because they think that everything happened in the past and that it doesn't matter anymore. When in reality, history shapes the way that we live our lives today. We should be grateful for all the things that did happen in the past otherwise we wouldn't have the lifestyle that we have now. <br><br>

        I have worked in Los Angeles since I was twelve years old. My family owns a market called Hercules Market. We had our market since 1986 and it has been in the family ever since. My father took charge in 2002 and made it into a corporation. Since we are family run, we have extremely loyal customers who have came for years. We are a multipurpose store that sells general food to tobacco to lotto tickets. It took awhile to get accustomed to all the new additions we constantly add to our store. Luckingly, we continue to remain open even while the big corporate stores are around us. We even have apartments on top of the store in order to attract more people. The relations formed with our neighbors is also a reason for our success. <br><br>

        I am the youngest in my family and one of the first to go to college. It gets difficult at times since there are not many people I can relate to. I work at my parentâ€™s store and take care of my cousin. My little cousin is fourteen and she is a handle but it has gotten easier. Her mother has been gone for two years now and I have custody of her daughter. We bought  a pug in November so that the house would not be so lonely. Hikaru has made it livelier since he is always making a ruckus in the house we never have a boring day. I just started going to therapy and it has helped my mental health considerably. I struggled with depression and anxiety and talking about my traumatic experiences and thoughts made me feel more okay.
